        "- Experimental Setup: What specifically are you doing to solve the problem, i.e.\\ what programming languages and libraries, how are you processing the data, what machine learning algorithms are you considering and what hyperparameters and value ranges, what measures you are using to evaluate them, what hyperparameter optimization method you chose, etc.\n",

        "algorithm and then optimize its hyperparameters). Choose a suitable\n",
        "hyperparameter optimizer; you could also use several and e.g. compare the\n",
        "results achieved by random search and Bayesian optimization. Make sure that the\n",
